## Description of Service

### What AIQ Provides

AIQ is a mobile application designed to help you track your cognitive capacity over time through periodic cognitive assessments. The service includes:

- **Cognitive Assessments** - Timed tests with questions designed to measure cognitive abilities across multiple domains (pattern recognition, logical reasoning, spatial awareness, verbal reasoning, and numerical reasoning)
- **IQ Score Estimates** - Statistical estimates of your cognitive performance, calculated using Item Response Theory (IRT) and presented on a standardized scale
- **Historical Tracking** - Storage and display of your test results over time to visualize trends
- **Fresh Questions** - AI-generated questions that rotate regularly to minimize practice effects
- **Periodic Reminders** - Optional push notifications to remind you to take assessments (recommended every 90 days)

### What AIQ Is NOT

It is critically important to understand what AIQ does NOT provide:

- **Not a Medical Device** - AIQ is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical condition, including cognitive impairment, dementia, ADHD, learning disabilities, or any other health condition
- **Not a Clinical IQ Test** - AIQ is not equivalent to professionally administered IQ tests (such as WAIS, Stanford-Binet, Woodcock-Johnson, or other standardized assessments) and should not be used as a substitute for such tests
- **Not for Official Use** - Results are for personal tracking only and should not be used for employment decisions, educational placement, disability determinations, legal proceedings, or any other official purpose
- **Not Professional Advice** - AIQ does not provide medical, psychological, educational, or professional advice of any kind

**Opt-Out:**

You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to legal@aiq.app within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.
