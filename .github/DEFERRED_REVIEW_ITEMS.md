## Deferred from PR #487 Review

### Certificate Pinning Documentation Enhancements

**Jira ticket**: [BTS-226](https://gioematt.atlassian.net/browse/BTS-226)

**Deferred items**:

1. **TestFlight verification step**: Add explicit TestFlight verification step to "Immediate Mitigation" section
   - *Original comment*: "Add a TestFlight verification step before submitting for expedited review"
   - *Reason deferred*: Partially duplicative - prevention checklist already mentions TestFlight testing

2. **Related Files reference section**: Add quick reference at top of recovery section
   - *Original comment*: "Add a 'Related Files' reference section at the top"
   - *Reason deferred*: Nice-to-have usability improvement, not critical for incident response

**Priority**: Low - Core recovery procedures are already accurate and functional
