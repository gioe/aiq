// The actual API client code is generated by the OpenAPI Generator plugin at build time
// from the openapi.json and openapi-generator-config.yaml files in this directory.
//
// Generated files include:
// - Types.swift: All request/response models from the OpenAPI spec
// - Client.swift: Type-safe methods for all API endpoints
//
// The generated code is internal to this module and re-exported for use by the AIQ app.
