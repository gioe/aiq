# Swift OpenAPI Generator Configuration
# This file configures the Swift OpenAPI Generator build plugin for the AIQ iOS app.
# The generator runs at build time to create type-safe Swift code from the OpenAPI spec.
#
# Documentation: https://github.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator
# Related: TASK-362

# Generate both types (models) and client code
generate:
  - types
  - client

# Keep generated code internal to the AIQ module
# This prevents exposing generated types as part of the public API
accessModifier: internal

# Use idiomatic Swift naming conventions
# This converts OpenAPI identifiers (snake_case, etc.) to Swift-idiomatic names (camelCase)
namingStrategy: idiomatic
