// This file previously contained APIClientProtocol, APIEndpoint, HTTPMethod, and the APIClient class.
// These have been replaced by OpenAPIServiceProtocol and OpenAPIService.
// See OpenAPIService.swift for the current API client implementation.
//
// This file is intentionally left minimal. It will be removed from the Xcode project
// in a future cleanup pass, along with supporting files (RetryPolicy, RequestInterceptor,
// TokenRefreshInterceptor) that are no longer referenced.
